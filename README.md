# Library 
In this project I'm gonna build a webpage in which you can add books and information related to them like title, pages and author and display that information on the webpage. 

This project is part from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library), specifically the Javascript Course.


## [LIVE PREVIEW](https://bast1ann.github.io/library-project/)

## Key Objectives
* Apply concepts on Objects and Objects Constructors to organize the Javascript code.

## Functionality
* You can add books and its information like: title, author, number of pages and if you have read or not the book.
* You can edit the read state of the book.
* You can delete books.

## Notes
* I tried to apply my own ideas about the styling and how to display the information about the books.
* This project is not supposed to store the information about the books, so if you refresh the page the books you added will disappear.
